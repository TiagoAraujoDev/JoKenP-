    Jokenpô App 🚀 in progress!
</h4>

<h3 id="pre-requisitos">Pré-requisitos</h3>

Before starting, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Git](https://git-scm.com).
Besides, it's good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

<h3 id="objetivo">🎯 Goals</h3>

- Getting better at programming in the only way that works... by practicing
- 05/26 => I already made the HTML structure and most of the CSS (of course I'm gonna change colors and other things and add some effects, but for now It's good). In Javascript I did almost all the core logic of the game.
- 05/28 => Game complete. Has minor changes in the responsiveness, but overall it's quite good. I apply some of my knowledge in Javascript in this project like the switch for change themes, transitions in CSS to make all animations smooth and javascript for make everything work as planned. For example, the play button is only available if a play option has been previously selected. I had a great time building this game and in the future I'll make some improvements and add some features.
